","body":"### Welcome to Active Delegate.\r\nElected officials who decide to use Active Delegate are making a commitment that all of their votes on legislation\r\nwill directly reflect the results of real-time polling done by the Active Delegate app. Active Delegate is party-neutral\r\nand ideology-neutral. To use Active Delegate, a politician simply has to sign a pledge that states they will follow the results of the app, and if they do not they cannot use the app to help govern.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Some general design principals of the app:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol><li>Authenticity: Active Delegate will require that each participant validate themselves as a real person.\r\n\r\nWhile voting record and position can remain anonymous, this approach to governance will only function\r\n\r\nif there is 100% trust in the validity of the polling.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Active Delegate makes politicians more into communicators of meaning of legislation to their constituents.\r\n\r\nThe final decision will be in the hands of the constituents. Thus, the app must create a vibrant discussion\r\n\r\ncommunity around legislation and allow for direct communication from politicians to people.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The app must be as freely accessible as possible via the web and mobile devices.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Because very few people will be able to research and vote every day on every issue, one of the fundamental\r\n\r\ndesign principals is \"autopolling\", which can be optionally enabled. Once enabled, the app will take your\r\n\r\npreferences on social and economic issues and cast a vote for you based on user-analysis of a given piece\r\n\r\nof legislation.</li></ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An example of the autopolling process:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A politician is elected on a platform that she will use the Active Delegate app to govern. Her constituents are\r\n\r\nall given an account in the system, and after authenticating they can log into the Active Delegate site or download\r\n\r\nthe app. Once there, they are initially asked a series of questions that ascertain their position on a variety\r\n\r\nof issues. Let's say, for the sake of this example, that a constituent determines that they are resolutely\r\n\r\npro-life, no matter what. So, a piece of legislation comes through the elected body that the users of the\r\n\r\napp determine, after research and presentation by the politician, that is pro-life. If the constituent has\r\n\r\ndetermined they are pro-life, the system would automatically cast a vote in support of the bill for the constituent\r\n\r\nif they have enabled and agreed to the terms of autopolling.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The plan is to build the system, refine it over the next year, and run candidates starting in 2013 or 2014.\r\n\r\nMy initial inclination is to use Ruby on Rails or Django for the web framework, and I believe both a webapp version\r\n\r\n(Sencha Touch?) and native iOS and Android versions will be built. This idea has been bouncing around my head for several years and I believe that if properly executed it could address many of the seemingly calcified issues facing our government in the United States, and Representative Democracies in general.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you can code, plan, or contribute in any way (including marketing, candidate recruitment, cheerleading) and are interested in helping to create a new type of Representational Democracy using our ubiquitous smart devices and web connections, then fork this project and start helping out.</p>\r\n"}
