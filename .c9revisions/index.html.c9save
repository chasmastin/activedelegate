To use Slingshot, a politician simply has to sign a pledge \n\t\tthat states they will follow the results of the app, and if they do not they cannot use the app to help govern.</p>  \n\n\t\t<p>Some general design principals of the app:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Authenticity:  Slingshot will require that each participant validate themselves as a real person.  \n\t\tWhile voting record and position can remain anonymous, this approach to governance will only function \n\t\tif there is 100% trust in the validity of the polling.</li>\n\n\t\t<li>Slingshot makes politicians more into communicators of meaning of legislation to their constituents.   \n\t\tThe final decision will be in the hands of the constituents.  Thus, the app must create a vibrant discussion \n\t\tcommunity around legislation and allow for direct communication from politicians to people.</li>\n\n\t\t<li>The app must be as freely accessible as possible via the web and mobile devices.</li>\n\n\t\t<li>Because very few people will be able to research and vote every day on every issue, one of the fundamental \n\t\tdesign principals is \"autopolling\", which can be optionally enabled.  Once enabled, the app will take your\n\t\tpreferences on social and economic issues and cast a vote for you based on user-analysis of a given piece \n\t\tof legislation.</li></ol>     \n\n\t\t<p>An example of the autopolling process:</p>\n\n\t\t<p>A politician is elected on a platform that she will use the Slingshot app to govern.  Her constituents are \n\t\tall given an account in the system, and after authenticating they can log into the Slingshot site or download \n\t\tthe app.  Once there, they are initially asked a series of questions that ascertain their position on a variety \n\t\tof issues.  Let's say, for the sake of this example, that a constituent determines that they are resolutely \n\t\tpro-life, no matter what.  So, a piece of legislation comes through the elected body that the users of the \n\t\tapp determine, after research and presentation by the politician, that is pro-life.  If the constituent has \n\t\tdetermined they are pro-life, the system would automatically cast a vote in support of the bill for the constituent\n\t\tif they have enabled and agreed to the terms of autopolling.</p>\n\n\n\t\t<p>The plan is to build the system, refine it over the next year, and run candidates starting in 2013 or 2014.  \n\t\tMy initial inclination is to use Ruby on Rails for the web framework, and I believe both a webapp version \n\t\t(Sencha Touch?) and native iOS and Android versions will be build.  No matter what, this has to be \n\t\tOpen Source Government.  This idea has been bouncing around my head for several years and I believe that if\n\t\tproperly executed it could address many of the seemingly calcified issues facing our government in the \n\t\tUnited States, and Representative Democracies in general.</p>  \n\n\t\t<p>Slingshot is just a working development title by the way, the actual app will have a different brand when \n\t\tpresented by candidates.  Our marketing department is working on it now...</p>\n\n\n      </section>\n      <footer>\n        <p>This project is maintained by <a href=\"https://github.com/chasmastin\">chasmastin</a></p>\n        <p><small>Hosted on GitHub Pages &mdash; Theme by <a href=\"https://github.com/orderedlist\">orderedlist</a></small></p>\n      </footer>\n    </div>\n    <script src=\"javascripts/scale.fix.js\"></script>\n    \n  </body>\n</html>"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":4924}]],"length":4924}
